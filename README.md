SimpleFigure README

SimpleFigure is a Processing 2.0 Class that was created to draw a scalable simple figure to the canvas. The SimpleFigure is comprised of a circular ellipse for the head and a rectangle, or a rectangle with rounded corners, for the torso. It has no limbs.

SimpleFigure was inspired by the “keyhole” figures, called “Keyhole Ken”, by Robin Hall in “The Cartoonists Workbook”
